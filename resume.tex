% I am a sophomore in the College of Engineering at the Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science. Many ask me "Why Computer Science?". Computer Science is not like the other sciences in the sense that one does not sit in a lab, mix chemicals and take measurements. In fact, if I told a "scientist" that the fundamental laws of nature do not directly affect the outcome of my "experiments", then they would say that what I do is not even a science. But before I even took a physics, chemistry or biology course, there was me sitting in my math class solving quadractic formulas. I saw a friend of mine punching numbers into his ti-84 and write down solutions and finish his problem set before I solved my first problem. I asked him how and he then showed me how to program the quadratic formula into the calculator. It was at this moment that I knew Computer Science can make people's lives better and that is why I pursue this field of knowledge.
